<h1>Never Gonna Give You Up</h1>
<h6>By Rick Astley</h6>
<blockquote>
    We're no strangers to love<br/>
You know the rules and so do I<br/>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br/>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
<br/>
We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside, we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br/>
<br/>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br/>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Ooh (Give you up)<br/>
Ooh-ooh (Give you up)<br/>
Ooh-ooh<br/>
Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)<br/>
Ooh-ooh<br/>
Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)<br/>
<br/>
We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside, we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
