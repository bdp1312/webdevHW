<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I enjoy setting up and configuring <acronym>GNU</acronym>-Linux home IT systems. I like to play guitar. I collect and catalog varrious genres of digital media, primarily animated japanese episodic series, action movies, and <!--extremly--> niche web comics. <!--Sometimes I spread misimormation on the internet. -->I ocasionally play video games, although I'm not very good and tend to loose interest in any given game quite quickly.</p>
